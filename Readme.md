[**Minecraft**](https://www.minecraft.net) is a sandbox video game developed by **Mojang Studios**. It was originally created by Markus "Notch" Persson and was first released in 2009, with the full version launching in 2011. The game allows players to explore, build, and survive in a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world made up of different types of blocks.

### Key Features of Minecraft:

1. **Open-World Exploration**: Minecraft offers vast, procedurally generated worlds where players can explore different biomes, such as forests, deserts, oceans, mountains, and more.

2. **Building and Crafting**: Players can mine blocks and resources, which they can then craft into tools, structures, and other items. The game has an extensive crafting system where players can create anything from simple tools to complex machinery.

3. **Survival Mode**: In this mode, players must gather resources, craft items, and survive against hostile mobs (such as zombies, skeletons, and creepers) while maintaining hunger and health levels. Players also need to build shelters to protect themselves from night-time dangers.

4. **Creative Mode**: In this mode, players have unlimited resources and are free to build anything they want without the need to worry about survival. This mode is often used for creating large structures and experimenting with designs.

5. **Multiplayer**: Minecraft allows players to connect and play together in online multiplayer worlds. There are public servers for a variety of game modes, including survival, creative, mini-games, and more.

6. **Redstone**: Minecraft includes a unique material called "redstone," which can be used to create complex circuits and contraptions, similar to electrical systems. This feature has made Minecraft popular for players who enjoy engineering and designing in-game machines.

7. **Modding Support**: Minecraft has a huge modding community that creates custom mods, maps, and texture packs, allowing players to customize their experience. Mods can add new gameplay mechanics, change the game's visuals, and introduce entirely new features.

8. **Cross-Platform Play**: Minecraft is available on many platforms, including PC (Java and Bedrock Editions), consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch), and mobile devices (iOS and Android). The game also supports cross-platform play, meaning players on different devices can join the same server.

### Editions of Minecraft:
- **Java Edition**: This is the original version for PC and is known for its strong modding support and the ability to run on most computers. It is exclusive to PC users.
  
- **Bedrock Edition**: This version is available on consoles, mobile, and Windows 10. It offers cross-platform play and is known for being more optimized for performance, especially on devices like phones and consoles.

### Popularity:
Minecraft is one of the best-selling video games of all time, with millions of active players across the world. Its sandbox nature and constant updates (including the addition of new features and biomes) keep players engaged, offering endless possibilities for creativity and adventure.

### Educational Value:
Many educators use Minecraft as a teaching tool, with the game's creative and problem-solving aspects supporting learning in areas such as mathematics, engineering, history, and environmental science.

Minecraft has become a cultural phenomenon, spawning merchandise, books, animated series, and even a film adaptation in development.
